# Minor Project:  
Airbnb front-end clone... or at least a rough impersonation of one.

## Features (yes, it actually does stuff):

- Dummy checkout page — looks legit, does nothing. Might hook up Razorpay later if motivation strikes.
- Wishlists — because fake trips deserve fake lists.
- Upcoming trips — as imaginary as your travel budget.
- House listings — all style, zero backend.
- Fully responsive — because we’re not animals.
- And some other bits I probably forgot.

## Try it out (or don’t, I’m not your boss):

## Someday, maybe:  
Host role — so you can fake-post your fake apartment in a fake marketplace. Ambitious, I know.
